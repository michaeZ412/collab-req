# Collaborate and Earn Extra Income

I'm looking for a collaborator based in the EU or North America who wants to earn some extra income.

## About Me

I have strong experience in freelancing and understand what clients are looking for and how to attract them. I also work with a team of skilled developers on various projects.

## The Opportunity

The more freelancing accounts we have, the more clients and projects we can take on. My goal is to build something incredible in the freelancing industry.

### Your Role

You don’t need to be an expert developer or even have a lot of time outside your primary job. Your role would simply involve:

- Creating an account on platforms like Upwork
- Occasionally meeting with clients (if needed)

The technical work and project management will be handled by me and my team.

### Your Earnings

- You'll earn **30%–35% of the profit** while spending just **1–2 hours a week** (or even less).
- Until we secure clients, I’ll pay you **$100–$200 per month** just for having the account.

## Why Join?

This is a great opportunity to make passive income and be part of something exciting in the freelancing world.

## Get in Touch

If you're interested, reach out to me on **Discord: mzsuper412**.

Let’s collaborate and build something amazing together!
